# ILLINOIS-DATATHON-2025---THE-MEOWS
Datathon project done by me and another buddy of mine. 

MOST LIKELY NOT USING ANY BRANCHES BUT HAVING GENERAL TID BITS FROM PAST PROJECTS CAN HELP AS IT ALSO INCLUDES MAIN COMMANDS TO PUSH FILES AND WHATNOT! 

## Stage Changes
- First, ensure your local branch is up to date with main
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git pull origin main
  ```
- Switch to your feature branch then merge any changes
  ```bash
  git checkout <branch-name>
  git merge main
  ```
- **IF THERE ARE ANY CONFLICTS STOP AND TEXT EACH OTHER SO WE CAN RESOLVE IT**
- Stage files you want to commit:
  ```bash
  git add <file_name> # or git add -A to add all changes
  ```
- Commit changes:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Add a detailed message of your changes here"
  ```
- Push your changes:
  ```bash
  git push
  ```
